# Product Guidelines: Mum_Finance

## Design Philosophy: Supportive Minimalism
The app should feel like a helpful companion, not a complex tool. Every design choice must prioritize clarity and ease of use for my Mum.

### Visual Identity
- **Minimalist Layouts:** Prioritize whitespace and large, readable typography. Avoid clutter at all costs.
- **Rich Visual Cues:** Use intuitive icons and simple color-coded bars to represent financial data, making it tangible at a glance.
- **Calming Palette:** Use a soft, neutral color scheme (blues, greens, greys) to reduce visual stress and create a supportive environment.

### Communication & Tone
- **Direct and Concise:** Use simple, everyday language. Labels should be short and descriptive. Sentences should be brief.
- **Gentle Support:** The app's voice should be helpful without being intrusive, ensuring she always feels in control.

### Accessibility Standards
- **High Legibility:** Ensure high contrast for text and critical interface elements.
- **Intuitive Navigation:** Large tap targets and a simple, logical flow between screens.
